In 2008, The Carter Center moved to the south wing of the mansion to monitor the historic election that marked the transition from the monarchical rule to parliamentary democracy in Nepal. President Carter came regularly to the Maya Manor to oversee the mission. The south wing has been named the Carter Wing in honor of his mission and his time at the mansion. The magnificently restored Maya Manor stands tall near the former Royal Palace showcasing the architectural grandeur of European colonial influence in South Asia. This style of architecture is a combination of Palladian, Corinthian, Neoclassical, and Baroque, and was introduced to Nepal by its aristocratic dictators, the Ranas (1846-1951). In order to maintain sovereignty and make peace with British Raj, the Ranas went on diplomatic missions to Britain and brought back this type of architectural flavor. These European- influenced mansions are peppered throughout the valley, some of which are notable governmental buildings like the Singha Durbar (Parliament and House of Representatives) and the Rastrapati Bhawan (Official Presidential Residence). The earthquake in 2015 partially damaged the mansion, but it was meticulously renovated by the founding Chairman of the KGH chain, Karna Sakya. A new block of seven-storied buildings with the same old colonial architecture was added to turn it into a hotel in 2016.
