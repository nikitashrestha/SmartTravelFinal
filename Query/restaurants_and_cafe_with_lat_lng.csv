After 27 Years of work on Human Rights issues, Ms Archana Tamang Lama Nepali wanted to fall back on something that would keep her close to three things she loves the most ‚ÄìNepal, People and Cooking. Cafe Aamu was established on Bhadra 26, 2071 B.S to bring together the diverse young minds of Nepal to offer them delicious soul food and a creative space they could call a second home. Over the years, Cafe Aamu has evolved into a social and cultural hub for aspiring, pro-nation Nepalis of all ages, thus, enabling an environment for them to network professionally and to put their passions and capacities together to contribute towards our Swadesh and nation-building. Cafe Aamu is located physically at Krishna Galli, Patan but lives in the hearts of thousands of young people as part of the Caf√© Aamu Family. Aamu serves authentic Eastern- Nepali food besides some dishes that could be termed Asian Fusion with ‚Äúthat extra dash of love‚Äù. The Caf√© is not only about food alone. It constantly engages in events such as musical performances, and art exhibitions and is a convergence point for young aspiring artists; poets, film and video makers, photographers, journalists, lawyers, doctors, cosmetic surgeons, educators, architects, engineers, economists, designers, and other talents across the board. With a very strong and non negotiable belief in Dignity, people power and Social Transformation, Caf√© Aamu, as a core value, engages in social and environmental causes- inclusion, disability, mental health, children‚Äôs rights, human rights, education and gender justice among others. Every paisa of the profit made goes into working on these issues till now.
